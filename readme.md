# Valentine's Day Webpage 💝

A romantic interactive webpage created as a hobby project for Valentine's Day.

## About

This is a simple, fun Valentine's Day webpage with three interactive pages:

1. **Opening Page** - A message box with a sweet greeting
2. **Question Page** - "Will you be my Valentine?" with interactive buttons
3. **Closing Page** - A celebration message

## Features

- 🎨 Soft pink and white color scheme
- 💕 Floating hearts animation
- 🎵 Background music ("Not Cute Anymore")
- ✨ Interactive "No" button that shrinks when clicked
- 🔤 Beautiful typography with Playfair Display and Poppins fonts
- 🎯 Personalization via URL parameter (e.g., `?name=YourName`)

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser or deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Personalization

Add a name parameter to the URL to personalize the greeting:
